I recently began working with Node.js. While I have been enjoying it, I'm still not comfortable with it. This is in a large part due to my lack of familiarity with popular Node.js projects. I don't know what are the go-to modules for most given tasks. Thankly I found this article on Hacker News that lists [twenty awesome node.js modules](http://blog.beyondfog.com/websockets-and-more-20-awesome-node-js-npm-modules-we-use-every-day/#.T44tY1Hreg8).
