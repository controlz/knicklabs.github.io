The Software Niagara website quietly went live last week. Thanks to [Michael Mottola](http://michaelencode.com/) for helping to develop the site and to [LeighAnn Frommann](http://www.leighannfrommann.com/) for designing our logo.

You can check out the website at [http://softwareniagara.com](http://softwareniagara.com). Be sure to sign-up for our [mailing list](http://www.softwareniagara.com/newsletter/new) so that we can keep you posted on upcoming events, like DemoCamp.

Stayed tuned for more features (and possibly better IE support).
